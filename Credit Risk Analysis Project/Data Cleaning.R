# Rules for data cleaning
# 1st rule: Maximum rows you can remove: 600. Don't remove any rows is the best.
# Replace any voices with other values
# State the final number of rows of dataset in documentation

# The best is to clean whole dataset, but you can choose to clean
# The columns you selected in your hypothesis or clean few more extra variables

# then export it as csv to let other members to import dataset for data analysis
